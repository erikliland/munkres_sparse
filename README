Implementation of the sparse kuhn-munkres algorithm.
For a general description of the full munkres algorithm, see
http://csclab.murraystate.edu/bob.pilgrim/445/munkres.html
This implementation assumes a non-complete graph and stores
the elements in a sparse matrix, following the ideas outlined
in (reference to the Sailor Assignment Problem paper)
